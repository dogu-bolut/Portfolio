# Dogu Bolut — Portfolio (Rust + WebAssembly)

Personal portfolio of Dogu Bolut, Software Developer, rebuilt as a [Leptos](https://leptos.dev) 0.8 client-side app compiled to WebAssembly and deployed as static files on Netlify.

This repository used to hold the original plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript version of the site. It was replaced by this Rust rebuild; the original is preserved in git history at commit `14ff382`.

All application code is Rust. The only JavaScript in `dist/` is the loader that Trunk and wasm-bindgen generate. The 7 game privacy-policy pages stay as static HTML so that Google Play's links and crawlers work without WASM.

## Prerequisites

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install trunk --version 0.21.14 --locked
```

Or download a prebuilt Trunk from <https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/releases>.

**Homebrew users:** if `brew install rust` put `cargo` ahead of rustup on your `PATH`, it can't see the wasm target and ignores `rust-toolchain.toml`. Put the rustup toolchain first:

```sh
export PATH="$(dirname "$(rustup which cargo)"):$PATH"
```

## Develop

```sh
./dev.sh               # http://localhost:8080, sets PATH for you
trunk serve            # same, if rustup's cargo is already first on PATH
```

`trunk serve` doesn't apply `public/_redirects`, so extensionless privacy URLs only work on Netlify or under `netlify dev`:

```sh
trunk build --release
npx netlify-cli dev --offline --dir=dist
```

## Build and check

```sh
trunk build --release  # output in dist/
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -- -D warnings
```

## Deploy to Netlify

1. Connect the repository in Netlify. All settings come from `netlify.toml`, so nothing needs entering in the UI.
2. Each push then builds and publishes `dist/`.

Netlify's build image ships `rustup` and `cargo`, and `rust-toolchain.toml` selects stable plus the wasm target. Trunk downloads `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-opt` itself. Check the Trunk release asset URL in `netlify.toml` at <https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/releases> if that step fails.

If Netlify builds are too slow, build locally and deploy with the CLI:

```sh
trunk build --release
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

Trunk hashes JS and WASM filenames, which is why `netlify.toml` can safely cache them as `immutable`.

## Assets

Assets are already in `public/assets/`. To fetch the originals again from the pre-rebuild commit:

```sh
BASE=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dogu-bolut/Portfolio/14ff382/assets
mkdir -p public/assets/{img,pdf,css,pages/privacy}
for f in logofalan.png web-development.png game_console.png graphics-design.png \
         worksamples1.png worksamples2.png worksamples3.png \
         brickpuzzle.svg whatsinmybag.png corridor.png mynewlife.jpg 3dspaceshooter.png \
         tilevania.jpg bountyhunter.jpg spacedrifter.png terminalhacker.png; do
  curl -fsSL "$BASE/img/$f" -o "public/assets/img/$f"
done
curl -fsSL "$BASE/pdf/Dogu%20Bolut%20CV%20-%20English.pdf" -o "public/assets/pdf/Dogu Bolut CV - English.pdf"
for s in brickpuzzle whatsinmybag mynewlife 3dspaceshooter tilevania bountyhunter spacedrifter; do
  curl -fsSL "$BASE/pages/privacy/$s.html" -o "public/assets/pages/privacy/$s.html"
done
```

Pages fetched this way are the original design, with its old scripts and stylesheets. The committed pages were rebuilt from them (see "Privacy pages" under Decisions), and `public/assets/css/legal.css` is written for this project, not fetched.

## Project layout

- `src/data.rs`: all content as typed constants
- `src/components/`, `src/pages/`: UI that only renders that data
- `src/dom.rs`: small browser helpers
- `style/`: design system, one file per area
- `public/`: copied as is into `dist/`

## Decisions

**Build**
- **Project root:** the project lives directly in this folder rather than a `dogubolut-rs/` subfolder.
- **CSS loading:** Trunk doesn't bundle local `@import`s, so `index.html` links each stylesheet in order. `main.css` loads last and holds only the global reduced-motion override.
- **`wasm-opt` flags:** `index.html` adds `data-wasm-opt-params="--enable-bulk-memory --enable-nontrapping-float-to-int"`. Trunk's bundled `wasm-opt` otherwise rejects what current Rust emits and the release build fails.
- **`strip = "debuginfo"` instead of `strip = true`:** full stripping removes the `target_features` section and makes wasm-bindgen warn. The cost is under 1 KB.
- **Extra dependency:** `send_wrapper` lets the non-`Send` `IntersectionObserver` and its `Closure` be held by Leptos's `on_cleanup`.

**Privacy pages**
- **Redesign:** the 7 game privacy pages were rebuilt to match the site, and they're still plain static HTML with no scripts, so Google Play's links and crawlers work without WASM. Each page now has:
  - the site's top bar ("Portfolio" brand and an outline "Back to Games" button)
  - a hero with the game's cover, name, last-updated date and a "Free game" chip
  - English and Turkish tabs that show one language at a time, opening in English. The tabs are radio buttons styled with CSS (`:has(#lang-tr:checked)`), so they need no script; browsers without `:has` show both languages
  - a contact card and the site's footer
- **Text unchanged:** the policy text is word for word the original. The rebuild script compared every word of both languages before writing each page. The "Note: For English, scroll down" line was replaced by the language tabs, and the copyright line has no year, because a static page can't keep it current.
- **One stylesheet:** `public/assets/css/legal.css` mirrors the colours in `style/tokens.css`; keep the two in step. It replaces the original `common.css`, `navbar.css` and `privacypolicy.css`, which were removed.
- **Back link:** the original used `<button onclick="...">`, which is inline JS. It is an `<a href="/games" class="btn-back-to-games">` link.

**Content and icons**
- **Icon:** `fab fa-css` exists in Font Awesome 6.7.1, so the `fa-css3-alt` fallback wasn't needed.
- **Tech icons:** Node, Angular and the generic database icon are replaced by Rust (Font Awesome), Claude and PostgreSQL. Font Awesome has no Claude or PostgreSQL icon, so those two are inline SVG paths from Simple Icons 13.21.0 (CC0).
- **Added labels:** the spec left the 404 line and link text open, so they are "The page you are looking for does not exist." and "Back to Home". Page meta descriptions and the "Skip to content" link are also new.
- **Kept as written:** the fourth certificate says "22 September 2020" but its text says "10/22/2020". The original site has the same mismatch.

**Visual cohesion (deliberate departures from the original)**
- **One accent family:** Book Meeting is filled orange-red and Download CV is a pastel-orange outline, replacing the original blue and green. The submit button is a pill like every other CTA.
- **Hero art:** the logo no longer pulses or hue-shifts, and it sits at 60% of a 360px square (280px on phones) with the tech icons on a ring around it, so they never overlap. The floating tech icons share one muted pastel orange and twinkle softly instead of using eight brand colours.
- **Shared width:** every hero illustration is capped by `--hero-visual` (440px).
- **Experience heroes:** the screenshot stack (Web), gameplay video (Games) and tilting illustration (ERP) are replaced by one shared app-window component, `Showcase`. Web shows a browser that cycles through the work samples; clicking it opens the image viewer. Games shows a library grid of all nine covers, each scrolling to its card. ERP shows the eight modules wired to one core, with a signal passing between them. The 42 MB `games-reel.mp4` and `erpwelcome.png` are no longer shipped; the originals are still in this repo's history (`14ff382`).
- **Warmer hero:** the blue glow in the hero background is gone.

**Engagement hook**
- **Progress tracker:** a floating pill (`ExploreTracker`) shows how many of the three experience pages the visitor has seen, with a step for each. Once all three are seen it becomes a "Seen it all? Let's talk" button to the booking link. Progress is kept in `localStorage` (`explored-v1`, in `src/progress.rs`); if storage is blocked, it only lasts for the visit.
- **Next up:** each experience page ends with a card pointing to the next experience not yet seen, or the meeting and CV buttons once all are seen.
- **Home tour card:** the home hero's main hook (`TourCard`). It lists the three experiences with their numbers, marks which are seen, and has one button that always leads to the next unseen page ("Start the tour", "Continue with Games", then the booking link). While the card is on screen the floating tracker hides, since it would say the same thing; an IntersectionObserver drives this.
- **Home proof:** an availability badge, a count chip on each experience card, a "Seen" marker, a "Start here" marker on the next unseen card, and a lead line under "Experiences".
- **Netlify badge:** on the free plan, Netlify adds a "Powered by Netlify" iframe (`#nl-badge-frame`, 202×64) in the bottom-right corner. Only when it is present (`body:has(#nl-badge-frame)`), back-to-top moves up at every width, and on screens up to 768px the tracker moves up too.
- **New copy:** the home description, the availability line and the tracker and Next up wording are new, not from the original site.

**Palette: vivid, not neon**
- **Accents:** the original hues, pulled one step back from pure neon in `style/tokens.css` (#FF4500 → #FF5A1F, #FF8C00 → #FF9431, #FFB347 → #FFBD72). They stay bright but are easier on the eyes.
- **Gradient for primary actions:** `--accent-gradient` (orange-red → orange) fills Book Meeting, Start the tour, Submit, the tracker and Next up buttons, and the section heading underlines. Hover adds glow instead of switching colour.
- **One glow per screen:** a soft orange glow (`--cta-glow`) marks only the key action in view: Start the tour on home, the navbar's Book Meeting on the experience pages (`body:not(:has(.tour-card))`), the Next up arrow at the end of each experience and Send in the contact form. Everything else uses neutral depth (`--lift`, `--shadow`), and buttons only glow on hover. Nothing pulses. "Learn more" pills are tinted at rest and fill with the gradient on hover.

**Contact form (Web3Forms)**
- **Why:** Formspree stopped delivering, Netlify Forms needs switching on in the dashboard, and FormSubmit was down when tested. [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com) needs no dashboard: the form posts to `https://api.web3forms.com/submit`, and each message arrives as an email.
- **Access key:** `FORM_ACCESS_KEY` in `src/data.rs`. It was created at web3forms.com for dogubolut@gmail.com. It's public by design: it can only send mail to that inbox. To change the receiving address, create a new key there and replace it.
- **How it works:** hidden fields set the email subject, the sender name and the page to return to (`redirect`, `https://dogubolut.netlify.app/thanks`). Bots that tick the hidden `botcheck` box are dropped. The sender's `email` field becomes the reply-to address, so replying to the email answers them directly.

**Contact form look**
- The form is a card: a "Send a message" header with a reply-time note, name and email side by side (stacked under 600px), fields with leading icons that turn orange on focus along with a soft focus ring, a full-width Submit button with a paper-plane icon, and a one-line privacy note. Field names, placeholders and the Submit label are unchanged.

**Contact details**
- Phone, email and location are rows with a caption (Call me, Email me, Based in). On hover or keyboard focus, the icon tile fills with the accent gradient, the text turns orange and an arrow slides in.

**Navigation from other pages**
- On pages without the home sections (`/thanks`, the 404), navbar links go home first and then scroll to the section (`AppState::pending_anchor`).

**Certificates and socials**
- **Certificates:** a two-column grid of cards. Each has an icon for its kind (course, summer camp, hackathon), an orange date, a completion or participation chip, a cursor-following glow (the same `dom::track_glow` as the glow links) and a lift on hover. The content is unchanged.
- **Social icons:** each has a 44px hit area that lifts, turns orange-red and glows on hover or keyboard focus.

**Behaviour**
- **Navbar height:** `<header id="home">` keeps its height when the bar goes fixed, so the page doesn't jump.
- **Meta description:** the static tag in `index.html` serves crawlers without WASM. The app removes it on start so each page's `<Meta>` is the only one.
- **Reduced motion:** the Web screenshots don't auto-cycle and the ERP signal doesn't run. Smooth scrolling becomes instant.
- **Keyboard support:** added a skip link, focus moving into the side menu and modal, focus returning when they close, and a Tab trap in the modal.
- **Thumbnails:** the browser screen and its three tabs are `<button>`s, so the keyboard can switch and open samples. Auto-cycling pauses on hover or focus.
- **Icon placement:** floating icons use percentage offsets from the image, not the original's fixed pixels, so they hold up at any size.
- **Unused assets:** images the new site doesn't reference, and the old `assets/js`, were not copied.
